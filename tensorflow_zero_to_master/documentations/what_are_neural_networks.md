# What are neural networks?

A neural network is a network or circuit of **neurons**, or in a model sense, an **artifical neural network**, composed of **artifcial neurons** or nodes.

> | input layer | hidden layer | output layer

```
input > numerical encoders > (pattern/features/weights) > outputs
```

## Anatomy of Neural Network

| input layer                      | hidden layer                               | output layer                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| data goes here (#unis/neurons 2) | learns patterns in data (#units/neurons 3) | output learned representation or prediction probabilities (#units/neurons 1) |

> Note: **patterns** is an arbitrary term, you'll often hear **embedding**, **weight**, **feature representation** **feature vectors** all referin to similiar things.

## Types of Learning

- **Supervised Learning** - always has labels
- **Semi-supervised Learning** - some labels
- **Unsupervised Learning** - nothing labels
- **Transfer Learning**
