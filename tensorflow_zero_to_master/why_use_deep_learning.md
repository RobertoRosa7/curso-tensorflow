# Why use deep learning?

## What deep learning is not good for robot

- **when you need explainability** - the patterns learned by a deep learning model are typically uninterpretable by a human.
- **when the tradition approach is a better option** - if you can accomplish what you need with a simple rule-based system.
- ** when errors are unacceptable** - since the outputs of deep learning model aren't always predicatble.
- **when you don't have much data** - deep learning models usualy require a fairly large amount of data to produce greate results.

## Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

- **Machine Learning** - tradiional machine learning algorithms have typically performed best on **structured** data.

  > **structured data** - is a data or information you can find in a excel or a Google Sheet, like a table or json file

- **Deep Learning** - typically performed better on unstructed data such as **natural language text**, **photos**, **voice**, **videos** etc..

- **Machine Learning Models**

  - Random forest
  - Naive bayes
  - Nearest neighbour
  - Support Vector Machine

- **Deep Learning Models**
  - Neural networks
  - Fully connected neural network
  - Convolutional neural network
  - Recurrent neural network
  - Transformer
