# What is and why use tensorflow?

## What is TensorFlow?

- End-to-End platform for machine learning
- Write fast deep learning code in Python able to run a GPU/TPU
- Able to access many pre-built deep learning models
- Whole stack: proccesss data, model data, deploy model in your application
- Originally designed and used in-house by Google

## Why Tensorflow?

- Easy model building
- Robust ML production anywhere
- Powerful experimentation for research

> With tools like colab, keras and tensorflow, virtually anyone can solve in a day, with no initial investment, problems that would have required an engineeing team working for a quarter and $20k in hadware in 2024. _FranÃ§ois Chollet_

## What is a GPU/TPU?

- **GPU** Graphics Proccessing Unit
- **TPU** Tensor Proccessing Unit
  > Tensor Proccessing Unit is an Accelerator application-specific integrated circuit developed by Google specificaly for neural network

## What is a tensor?

## What we're going to cover

- Tensorflow basics & fundamentals
- Preprocessing data
- Building and using pretrained deep learning models
- fitting a model to the data (learning patterns)
- Making predictions with a model
- Evaluation model predictions
- Saving and loading models
- Using a trained model to make predictions an custom data
